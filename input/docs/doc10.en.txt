This indicator, that later serves Eurostat to incorporate in the inflation rate calculation in the European Union, provides a prediction of how Spanish prices would evolve during November.
Its publication corresponds with Eurostat and the European Central bank   (  BCE  )   policy to offer high quality, timely data comparable with the ones produced in the United States.
This advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used by the Consumer Price Index Harmonized, but using different methods of statistical modelling to account for information which isn't available at the moment of its publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the indicator is only an example, it need not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will be announced next December 14.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels".
The second vice-president and Economy minister, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the IPC increase to 4.1% in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time expressed hopes that the index prices will continue at "relatively high" levels for the next months.
In any case Solbes has emphasized in the Congress corridors that "although the figure is not good" Spanish inflation differential with respect to the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
Also explained that November "has been less of a surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%", recognized the Economy minister with respect to the advance data today.
